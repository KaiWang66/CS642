     Since check_fail() in target used strcpy function, we can apply buffer overflow technique here to change the 
return address to the "else" statement so that the grade will be changed to A. 
     Notice that the buffer size is 20 byte, followed by old frame number and return address, so we are trying to
write 28 bytes in total to overwrite the return address.
     By using gdb, we get the address we want to return, which will change the grade, but at the same time, we 
should keep the old frame number unchanged. We can get this number by knowing %ebp of the new frame.
     Then, the final buffer looks like "SSSS SSSS SSSS SSSS SSSS FFFF SSSS", where S stands for the return addr
and F stands for the old frame number.
