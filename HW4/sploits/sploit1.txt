Use this file to explain how your sploit1 works.

    This target is a simple example of buffer overflow. It uses strcpy which don't have bound check so that we can insert 
shellcode and overwrite the return address to the head of the buffer, similar to sploit0.
    Since the buffer size is 160, we need 168 (we need to skip sfp) bytes to overwrite the return address. The composition of
buffer is like NNNNNNNNNNSSSSSSSSSSSSRRRR, where N stands for NOP, S stands for shell codes, and R stands for the 
beginning address of the buffer, here is the first N.
    Instead of guessing, we can figure out the exact address. Like sploit0, by using gdb, we are able to figure out the ebp
esp by using asm helper function. Then it is not hard to find out the exact address, we copied that address to R and we
are done.
